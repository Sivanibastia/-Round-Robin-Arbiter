# -Round-Robin-Arbiter
 • Designed a Round Robin Arbiter to manage fair access to shared resources among multiple requesters in digital systems.
 
 • Implemented 4-input and 8-input arbiter modules using priority rotation logic to ensure equal resource allocation.
 • Created Verilog testbenches to simulate and validate arbitration behavior over multiple clock cycles.
 • Enabled deterministic and conflict-free scheduling using clock-synchronized round-robin decision mechanism.
